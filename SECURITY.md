# PostgreSQL Security Hardening Guide

This document provides comprehensive guidance on securing your PostgreSQL database based on the security test results.

## Security Vulnerabilities Addressed

Based on our security testing, we've identified and addressed the following vulnerabilities:

1. **Union-Based SQL Injection**
   - Vulnerable function: `test_union_injection`
   - Fix: Implemented input validation and parameterized queries

2. **Buffer Overflow Risks**
   - 32 functions accepting text inputs identified as potentially vulnerable
   - Fix: Created input size validation and secure wrapper functions

3. **Configuration Weaknesses**
   - Logging configuration not optimal for security monitoring
   - SSL/TLS settings not fully hardened
   - Fix: Enhanced security configuration with stricter settings

4. **Lack of Real-time Monitoring**
   - No comprehensive security monitoring system
   - Fix: Implemented real-time security monitoring and alerting

## Security Tiers Implemented

### Tier 1: Basic Security

- **Role-based Access Control**
  - Created roles with appropriate privileges: app_readonly, app_readwrite, app_admin
  - Created users with appropriate roles
  - Restricted superuser access

- **Password Policies**
  - Enforced strong password hashing (scram-sha-256)
  - Implemented password complexity requirements

- **Connection Restrictions**
  - Limited failed login attempts
  - Set secure session defaults (timeouts)

### Tier 2: Intermediate Security

- **Encryption (Data at Rest)**
  - Installed pgcrypto extension
  - Created functions to encrypt sensitive data
  - Identified and encrypted sensitive columns

- **Audit Logging**
  - Set up comprehensive audit logging
  - Created audit triggers for sensitive tables
  - Implemented audit log analysis

- **Row-Level Security**
  - Enabled row-level security on sensitive tables
  - Created policies for different roles
  - Tested policy effectiveness

### Tier 3: Advanced Security

- **SSL/TLS Encryption (Data in Transit)**
  - Enabled SSL/TLS
  - Configured secure cipher suites
  - Enforced server-side cipher preferences

- **Advanced Authentication**
  - Implemented password complexity checks
  - Created functions to detect brute force attacks
  - Set up anomalous login detection

- **Intrusion Detection**
  - Created security event monitoring
  - Implemented suspicious query detection
  - Set up real-time alerting for security events

## Security Monitoring

We've implemented a comprehensive security monitoring system:

1. **Security Event Logging**
   - All security-related events are logged to `security_monitoring.security_events`
   - Events are categorized by type and severity
   - Detailed information is captured for forensic analysis

2. **Suspicious Activity Detection**
   - Monitors for suspicious queries (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE, etc.)
   - Detects potential SQL injection patterns
   - Identifies privilege escalation attempts

3. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Detects logins at unusual times
   - Identifies logins from unusual locations
   - Monitors for unusually high login frequency

4. **Security Reporting**
   - Generates security reports with `security_monitoring.generate_security_report()`
   - Provides a dashboard view with `security_monitoring.recent_events`
   - Tracks security incidents and their resolution

## How to Apply Security Fixes

1. Run the `apply_security_fixes.bat` script to apply all security fixes:
   ```
   .\apply_security_fixes.bat
   ```

2. Verify that the fixes have been applied by running the security tests:
   ```
   py run_sql_injection_tests.py
   ```

3. Review the test results to ensure that all vulnerabilities have been addressed.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Regular Security Testing**
   - Run security tests regularly (at least monthly)
   - Update tests as new vulnerabilities are discovered
   - Integrate security testing into your CI/CD pipeline

2. **Keep PostgreSQL Updated**
   - Apply security patches promptly
   - Subscribe to PostgreSQL security announcements
   - Plan regular upgrade cycles

3. **Monitor Security Events**
   - Review security logs regularly
   - Investigate suspicious activities
   - Establish an incident response plan

4. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Implement regular backups
   - Test recovery procedures
   - Encrypt backup files

5. **Network Security**
   - Use firewalls to restrict database access
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Consider using a VPN for remote access
