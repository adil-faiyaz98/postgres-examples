# **The Full Workflow: How Everything Works Together**
### **Threat Detection and AI-Driven Security**
1. **User logs in or executes a query** → Logged in `uba/user_activity_logs.sql`  
2. **UBA detects unusual behavior** → Anomaly flagged in `ml/anomaly_predictions.sql`  
3. **ML model checks for high-risk indicators** → If a threat is detected:  
   - Logs into `logs.notification_log`  
   - AI suggests an adaptive security policy update (`feedback_loop/improve_security_policies.sql`)  
   - If confirmed, updates SOAR playbooks and triggers AWS Security Hub  

---

### **Blockchain and Federated Learning**
1. **AI flags a high-risk SQL injection attempt** → `blockchain/publish_security_event_to_blockchain.sql` logs it  
2. **Blockchain smart contract validates the threat** (`blockchain/validate_security_event_on_blockchain.sql`)  
3. **Federated learning nodes update AI threat models** (`federated_learning/train_federated_ai_model.sql`)  
4. **SOAR triggers playbook actions** (`soar/trigger_soar_security_playbook.sql`)  

---

### **Automated Incident Response and Remediation**
1. **Suspicious login detected** (`ml/detect_anomalies.sql`)  
2. **UBA cross-checks with historical patterns** (`uba/detect_behavior_anomalies.sql`)  
3. **Incident Response Pipeline:**
   - **SOAR triggers AWS Lambda to revoke credentials** (`incident_response/revoke_aws_iam_credentials.sql`)  
   - **Firewall blocks suspicious IP** (`incident_response/block_malicious_ips.sql`)  
   - **Threat Intelligence shares findings** (`threat_sharing/ingest_taxii_threat_feeds.sql`)  

---

### **Continuous Learning and Security Policy Optimization**
1. **AI learns from SOAR actions** → `rl/assign_rewards_based_on_action.sql`  
2. **AI security policies are updated dynamically** (`rl/adaptive_security_policies.sql`)  
3. **SOAR auto-tunes its playbooks based on effectiveness** (`soar/update_soar_playbooks.sql`)

- **Automated Security:** AI, ML, and SOAR continuously monitor and mitigate threats.  
- **Tamper-Proof Logging:** Blockchain ensures audit logs cannot be altered.  
- **Zero-Trust and Post-Quantum Security:** Implements decentralized identity verification.
