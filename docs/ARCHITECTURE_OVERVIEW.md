# PostgreSQL Security Framework Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of how all components in the PostgreSQL Security Framework work together to create a complete security solution.

## System Architecture

The PostgreSQL Security Framework consists of several interconnected components:

## Component Integration

### 1. Database Security Controls

The core database security controls include:

- **Authentication**: Managed by the `auth` schema with functions like `register_user()` and `authenticate_user()`
- **Authorization**: Implemented through role-based access control and row-level security policies
- **Encryption**: Column-level encryption using pgcrypto for sensitive data
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive logging of security events in the `logs.notification_log` table

These controls are implemented in:
- `scripts/security/unified_auth_system.sql` - Authentication and session management
- `scripts/security/access_control.sql` - Role-based access control
- `scripts/security/row_level_security.sql` - Data isolation through RLS
- `scripts/security/audit_logging.sql` - Security event logging

### 2. Security Tiers

The security tiers provide a layered approach to security:

- **Basic Tier**: Essential security controls for development environments
- **Standard Tier**: Comprehensive security for production environments
- **Advanced Tier**: Enhanced security for high-security environments

Each tier builds upon the previous one:
- `security_tiers/basic/setup.sql` - Basic security controls
- `security_tiers/standard/setup.sql` - Includes basic tier and adds more controls
- `security_tiers/advanced/setup.sql` - Includes standard tier and adds advanced features

### 3. Zero Trust Architecture

The zero trust architecture ensures that every access request is fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted:

- **Authentication Service**: External service that validates JWT tokens
- **Auth Service Connector**: Synchronizes sessions between PostgreSQL and the auth service
- **JWT Validation**: Validates tokens for every request
- **Network Policies**: Restricts communication between services

Components:
- `kubernetes/zero-trust/istio-config.yaml` - Service mesh configuration
- `kubernetes/zero-trust/jwt-auth.yaml` - JWT authentication policies
- `scripts/security/auth_service_connector.py` - Authentication service integration

### 4. Monitoring & Alerting

The monitoring and alerting system detects and responds to security events:

- **Security Monitoring**: Runs queries to detect suspicious activities
- **Anomaly Detection**: Identifies unusual patterns in database access
- **Threat Detection**: Uses Falco to detect runtime security threats
- **Alerting**: Sends notifications when security events are detected

Components:
- `scripts/monitoring/security_monitoring.sh` - Security monitoring script
- `kubernetes/threat-detection/anomaly-detection.yaml` - Anomaly detection service
- `kubernetes/threat-detection/falco-config.yaml` - Runtime security monitoring
- `monitoring/dashboards/security-monitoring-dashboard.json` - Security dashboard

### 5. Compliance & Reporting

The compliance and reporting system ensures adherence to security standards:

- **Compliance Checks**: Validates configuration against security standards
- **Compliance Reports**: Generates reports for audit purposes
- **Remediation**: Provides guidance for addressing compliance issues

Components:
- `scripts/compliance/check_compliance.sh` - Compliance validation script
- `scripts/compliance/generate_report.sh` - Compliance reporting script

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**:
   ```
   Client → Authentication Request → auth.authenticate_user() → JWT Token → Client
   ```

2. **Authorization Flow**:
   ```
   Client → Request with JWT → auth.validate_session() → Set Context → RLS Filters Data → Response
   ```

3. **Monitoring Flow**:
   ```
   Database Events → logs.notification_log → security_monitoring.sh → Alerts/Dashboard
   ```

4. **Zero Trust Flow**:
   ```
   Request → Istio Gateway → JWT Validation → Service → PostgreSQL → RLS → Data
   ```

## Integration Points

### 1. Application Integration

Applications integrate with the security framework through:
- PostgreSQL connection with authentication
- Setting application context for RLS
- Using encryption for sensitive data
- Logging security events

See `docs/INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed integration instructions.

### 2. Infrastructure Integration

The security framework integrates with infrastructure through:
- Kubernetes deployments with security contexts
- Network policies for traffic control
- Secrets management for credentials
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure

### 3. CI/CD Integration

The security framework integrates with CI/CD pipelines through:
- Pre-commit hooks for early security checks
- Security scanning in CI/CD workflows
- Compliance validation before deployment
- Automated testing of security controls

## Testing Coverage

The security framework includes comprehensive testing:
- Unit tests for security functions
- Integration tests for component interactions
- Security tests for vulnerability detection
- Compliance tests for standard adherence

Test files:
- `test/pgTAP/04-security_test.sql` - Basic security tests
- `test/pgTAP/05-advanced-security-test.sql` - Advanced security tests
- `test/pgTAP/test_row_level_security.sql` - RLS tests
- `test/integration/zero-trust-test.sh` - Zero trust integration tests
- `test/integration/threat-detection-test.sh` - Threat detection tests

## Deployment

The security framework can be deployed using:
- Docker for local development
- Kubernetes for production environments
- Terraform for cloud deployments

Deployment files:
- `docker/Dockerfile` - Docker image definition
- `kubernetes/postgres-statefulset.yaml` - Kubernetes deployment
- `terraform/main.tf` - Terraform infrastructure

## Conclusion

The PostgreSQL Security Framework provides a comprehensive security solution with multiple integrated components. Each component plays a specific role in the overall security architecture, and together they create a defense-in-depth approach to database security.

By following the integration guides and deployment instructions, you can implement this security framework in your environment and achieve a high level of security for your PostgreSQL databases.
