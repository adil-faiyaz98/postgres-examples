# **PostgreSQL AI-Driven Security and Cyber Defense System**  

This repository aims to provide, to an extent, a **secure, AI-powered, and automation-driven PostgreSQL security and monitoring framework**. It integrates **machine learning, blockchain, federated learning, and SOAR security automation** to provide a **real-time cyber defense system**.

## **Features**  
- **Automated Threat Detection**: AI-driven anomaly detection, real-time risk scoring, and reinforcement learning security policies.  
- **Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR)**: Automated incident response using AWS Lambda, firewall integration, and policy adaptation.  
- **Blockchain-Based Security Logging**: Immutable, tamper-proof security logs stored on a blockchain for forensic validation.  
- **Federated Learning for Global Threat Intelligence**: AI models trained collaboratively across PostgreSQL security nodes.  
- **Zero Trust and Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Decentralized identity verification, Zero-Knowledge Proof authentication, and Kyber encryption.  
- **User Behavior Analytics (UBA)**: Behavioral anomaly detection, risk scoring, and adaptive security policies based on AI insights.

## **Database Security and Threat Monitoring**  

### **Monitoring and Log Analysis**  
- View PostgreSQL security logs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM logs.notification_log ORDER BY logged_at DESC LIMIT 50;
```
- Analyze user behavior anomalies:
```sql
SELECT * FROM uba.user_activity_logs WHERE event_type = 'Suspicious Login' ORDER BY event_timestamp DESC;
```
- Check detected SQL injection attempts:
```sql
SELECT * FROM ml.anomaly_predictions WHERE event_type = 'SQL Injection Attempt' ORDER BY detected_at DESC;
```

### **Incident Response and SOAR Integration**  
- Block an identified malicious IP:
```sql
SELECT incident_response.block_malicious_ip('192.168.1.100', 'Detected as a high-risk threat');
```
- Disable a compromised user account:
```sql
SELECT security.auto_lock_user('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000');
```
- Trigger an AWS Lambda function for automatic response:
```sql
SELECT incident_response.trigger_aws_lambda_security_playbook();
```

## **Security Policy and AI Model Management**  

### **Training AI Security Models**  
Train a deep learning model for threat detection:  
```sql
SELECT deep_learning.train_security_model();
```
Retrain AI security models using reinforcement learning feedback:  
```sql
SELECT rl.retrain_security_ai_model();
```

### **Federated Learning and Blockchain Security**  
- Share local AI models with the federated security network:
```sql
SELECT federated_learning.send_model_to_fl_node();
```
- Publish PostgreSQL security events to blockchain:
```sql
SELECT blockchain.publish_security_event();
```

# **SECURITY.md (Security Best Practices and Compliance)**  

# **Security Policy**  

## **Access Control and Role Management**  
- **Principle of Least Privilege**:  
  - Application users are assigned **minimum required privileges** for database access.  
  - Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to enforce user-specific data access restrictions.  
- **Database Role Segmentation**:  
  - **`db_admin`**: Full administrative privileges.  
  - **`app_user`**: Limited data modification privileges.  
  - **`readonly_user`**: Read-only access to selected tables.  
  - **`security_admin`**: Monitors and responds to security incidents.  

## **Authentication and Encryption**  
- **Password Policies**:  
  - All PostgreSQL users must authenticate using **SCRAM-SHA-256** encryption.  
  - Passwords must be **at least 12 characters long** and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**:  
  - All database connections **must use SSL/TLS** to prevent eavesdropping.  
  - Configure PostgreSQL to **enforce SSL for external connections** (`hostssl` in `pg_hba.conf`).  
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**:  
  - Data is encrypted using **Kyber512** for protection against quantum computing attacks.  
  - Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to verify security policies without exposing sensitive data.  

## **Audit Logging and Security Monitoring**  
- **Audit all database modifications** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`):  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs.table_audit_log ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 50;
  ```
- **Log and investigate failed login attempts**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs.notification_log WHERE event_type = 'FAILED_LOGIN' ORDER BY logged_at DESC;
  ```
- **Regular Security Log Review**:  
  - PostgreSQL security logs are stored in `logs/` and ingested into **SIEM systems** for real-time analysis.  
  - **Security alerts are escalated to AWS Security Hub and PagerDuty.**  

## **Incident Response and Threat Mitigation**  
- **Automated SOAR Playbooks**:  
  - **Block high-risk IPs** detected by AI:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.block_malicious_ips('192.168.1.105', 'Detected from AWS GuardDuty Threat Intelligence');
    ```
  - **Suspend compromised accounts** automatically:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.suspend_compromised_users('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000');
    ```
  - **Trigger PagerDuty security alerts**:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.trigger_pagerduty_alert();
    ```

## **AI and Machine Learning Security**  
- **Anomaly Detection with AI**:  
  - Uses **Amazon Lookout for AI-based anomaly detection**.  
  - Detects **abnormal query execution times, suspicious logins, and privilege escalations**.  
- **Federated Learning and AI Threat Intelligence**:  
  - PostgreSQL nodes collaborate using **Federated Learning** to train **AI models securely** without sharing raw data.  
  - Security models are updated **every 24 hours** based on global intelligence.  
- **Explainability in AI Security**:  
  - All AI predictions include **confidence scores and justification** for decisions.

## **Zero Trust Security and Decentralized Authentication**  
- **Decentralized Identity (DID) Authentication**:  
  - PostgreSQL authentication uses **DID-based Zero Trust architecture**.  
  - AI dynamically adjusts authentication policies based on **risk scores**.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Security Verification**:  
  - **Sensitive queries are verified via ZKP authentication**, ensuring **confidentiality and data integrity**.

---

## **Compliance and Best Practices**  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:  
  - Adheres to the **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover** security model.  
- **GDPR Compliance**:  
  - Implements **data anonymization, encryption, and access logging** to comply with EU privacy laws.  
- **SOC 2 Type II Security**:  
  - Ensures **continuous security monitoring and access controls** for compliance with industry standards.
