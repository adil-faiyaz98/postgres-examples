## **Security Assessment and Monitoring**  

### **Threat Detection and Monitoring**  
- View PostgreSQL security logs:
```sql
SELECT * FROM security.audit_log ORDER BY audit_time DESC LIMIT 50;
```
- Analyze user behavior anomalies (Standard/Advanced tiers):
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_monitoring.anomalies WHERE username = current_user ORDER BY detection_time DESC;
```
- Check AI security predictions (Advanced tier):
```sql
SELECT * FROM ai_security.security_predictions ORDER BY prediction_time DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### **Incident Response**  
- Review suspicious activity (Standard/Advanced tiers):
```sql
SELECT * FROM security_monitoring.check_suspicious_activity();
```
- Block a detected malicious IP:
```sql
SELECT security.block_ip('192.168.1.100', 'Detected as a high-risk threat');
```
- Disable a compromised user account:
```sql
SELECT security.lock_user('suspicious_user');
```

## **Performance Testing**

Benchmark the performance impact of each security tier in your environment:

```bash
./test/performance/benchmark_security_tiers.sh
```

This will generate a detailed report showing the performance characteristics of each security tier.

# **SECURITY.md (Security Best Practices and Compliance)**  

# **Security Policy**  

## **Access Control and Role Management**  
- **Principle of Least Privilege**:  
  - Application users are assigned **minimum required privileges** for database access.  
  - Use **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to enforce user-specific data access restrictions.  
- **Database Role Segmentation**:  
  - **`db_admin`**: Full administrative privileges.  
  - **`app_user`**: Limited data modification privileges.  
  - **`readonly_user`**: Read-only access to selected tables.  
  - **`security_admin`**: Monitors and responds to security incidents.  

## **Authentication and Encryption**  
- **Password Policies**:  
  - All PostgreSQL users must authenticate using **SCRAM-SHA-256** encryption.  
  - Passwords must be **at least 12 characters long** and include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters.  
- **SSL/TLS Encryption**:  
  - All database connections **must use SSL/TLS** to prevent eavesdropping.  
  - Configure PostgreSQL to **enforce SSL for external connections** (`hostssl` in `pg_hba.conf`).  
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**:  
  - Data is encrypted using **Kyber512** for protection against quantum computing attacks.  
  - Use **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)** to verify security policies without exposing sensitive data.  

## **Audit Logging and Security Monitoring**  
- **Audit all database modifications** (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`):  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs.table_audit_log ORDER BY changed_at DESC LIMIT 50;
  ```
- **Log and investigate failed login attempts**:  
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM logs.notification_log WHERE event_type = 'FAILED_LOGIN' ORDER BY logged_at DESC;
  ```
- **Regular Security Log Review**:  
  - PostgreSQL security logs are stored in `logs/` and ingested into **SIEM systems** for real-time analysis.  
  - **Security alerts are escalated to AWS Security Hub and PagerDuty.**  

## **Incident Response and Threat Mitigation**  
- **Automated SOAR Playbooks**:  
  - **Block high-risk IPs** detected by AI:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.block_malicious_ips('192.168.1.105', 'Detected from AWS GuardDuty Threat Intelligence');
    ```
  - **Suspend compromised accounts** automatically:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.suspend_compromised_users('123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000');
    ```
  - **Trigger PagerDuty security alerts**:
    ```sql
    SELECT incident_response.trigger_pagerduty_alert();
    ```

## **AI and Machine Learning Security**  
- **Anomaly Detection with AI**:  
  - Uses **Amazon Lookout for AI-based anomaly detection**.  
  - Detects **abnormal query execution times, suspicious logins, and privilege escalations**.  
- **Federated Learning and AI Threat Intelligence**:  
  - PostgreSQL nodes collaborate using **Federated Learning** to train **AI models securely** without sharing raw data.  
  - Security models are updated **every 24 hours** based on global intelligence.  
- **Explainability in AI Security**:  
  - All AI predictions include **confidence scores and justification** for decisions.

## **Zero Trust Security and Decentralized Authentication**  
- **Decentralized Identity (DID) Authentication**:  
  - PostgreSQL authentication uses **DID-based Zero Trust architecture**.  
  - AI dynamically adjusts authentication policies based on **risk scores**.  
- **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Security Verification**:  
  - **Sensitive queries are verified via ZKP authentication**, ensuring **confidentiality and data integrity**.

---

## **Compliance and Best Practices**  
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**:  
  - Adheres to the **Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, Recover** security model.  
- **GDPR Compliance**:  
  - Implements **data anonymization, encryption, and access logging** to comply with EU privacy laws.  
- **SOC 2 Type II Security**:  
  - Ensures **continuous security monitoring and access controls** for compliance with industry standards.
