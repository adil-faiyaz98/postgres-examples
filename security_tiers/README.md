# PostgreSQL Security Tiers

This directory contains a tiered approach to implementing PostgreSQL security, allowing organizations to choose the appropriate security level based on their requirements, risk tolerance, and performance considerations.

## Overview

The security tiers provide progressively stronger security controls:

1. **Basic Tier**: Essential security features with minimal performance impact
2. **Standard Tier**: Comprehensive security suitable for most applications
3. **Advanced Tier**: High-security implementation with AI-driven protections

## Choosing the Right Tier

| Consideration | Basic | Standard | Advanced |
|---------------|-------|----------|----------|
| Performance Impact | Minimal (1-5%) | Moderate (5-15%) | Significant (15-30%) |
| Security Level | Essential | Enhanced | Maximum |
| Compliance | Basic compliance | Most regulations | All including high-security |
| Ease of Implementation | Simple | Moderate | Complex |
| Maintenance Overhead | Low | Medium | High |

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- PostgreSQL 13+ (15+ recommended)
- Superuser access to PostgreSQL
- Required extensions (pgAudit, pgcrypto, etc.)

### Installation

1. Choose your desired security tier
2. Run the corresponding setup script:

```bash
# For basic security
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f security_tiers/basic/setup.sql

# For standard security
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f security_tiers/standard/setup.sql

# For advanced security
psql -U postgres -d your_database -f security_tiers/advanced/setup.sql
```

## Tier Features

### Basic Tier

- Essential PostgreSQL hardening
- Secure configuration settings
- Basic audit logging with pgAudit
- TLS/SSL for connections
- Robust password policies
- Minimal performance impact

### Standard Tier

All Basic features, plus:
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Enhanced monitoring and alerts
- Query anomaly detection
- Role-based access control
- Sensitive data protection
- Security event monitoring
- Moderate performance impact

### Advanced Tier

All Standard features, plus:
- AI-driven security analysis
- Machine learning anomaly detection
- Advanced encryption
- Real-time threat monitoring
- Row-level security policies
- Adaptive security responses
- Higher performance impact

## Performance Considerations

The security tiers have varying levels of performance impact. Run the performance benchmark script to measure the impact in your environment:

```bash
./test/performance/benchmark_security_tiers.sh
```

## Compliance Mapping

| Regulation | Basic | Standard | Advanced |
|------------|-------|----------|----------|
| SOC 2 | Partial | Most | Full |
| PCI DSS | Basic requirements | Most requirements | Full compliance |
| HIPAA | Limited | Most safeguards | Full safeguards |
| GDPR | Basic protections | Most protections | Full compliance |
| ISO 27001 | Partial | Substantial | Full |

## Customization

Each tier can be customized to meet specific requirements. The modular design allows for selective implementation of security controls based on your organization's needs.
