# PostgreSQL Security Framework Threat Model

## Overview

This document provides a detailed threat model for the PostgreSQL AI-Driven Security and Cyber Defense System. It identifies potential threats, vulnerabilities, and recommended mitigations using the STRIDE methodology (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information disclosure, Denial of service, Elevation of privilege).

## System Components

| AI/ML Security Models | Anomaly detection using ML | Advanced |
| Encryption Layer | Data encryption services | Standard, Advanced |
| Monitoring System | Real-time security monitoring | Standard, Advanced |
| Authentication System | User authentication and access control | All |

## Threat Actors

1. **External Attackers**
   - Unauthorized users attempting to gain access
   - Sophisticated attackers using zero-day exploits
   - Botnets performing automated attacks

2. **Malicious Insiders**
   - Employees with legitimate access misusing privileges
   - Contractors with temporary access
   - Former employees with active credentials

3. **Inadvertent Actors**
   - Users who unintentionally cause security incidents
   - Administrators making configuration errors

## Verification and Testing

Each security control should be tested using:

1. **Regular penetration testing** - External security assessment
2. **Automated security scanning** - Regular vulnerability checks
3. **Compliance audits** - Verification against regulatory standards
4. **Red team exercises** - Simulated attack scenarios

## Incident Response Process

1. **Detection** - Identify security incidents through monitoring
2. **Containment** - Limit the impact of the incident
3. **Eradication** - Remove the threat from the system
4. **Recovery** - Restore normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned** - Update security controls based on findings

## Continuous Improvement

The threat model should be reviewed and updated:
- After significant infrastructure changes
- When new threats emerge
- After security incidents
- On a regular schedule (at least annually)
- When implementing new database features
